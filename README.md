# vrbot, aka Hubot

This is a version of GitHub's Campfire/chat/automation bot, hubot. He's pretty cool.

This is our hubot instance that livens up our talker room.

- For info on hubot: <http://hubot.github.com/>

- To find out how to write scripts: <http://theprogrammingbutler.com/blog/archives/2011/10/28/hubot-scripts-explained/>
    Any script you add in the "scripts" directory will be automatically loaded. so that's where I put our first custom one.
    (Say "compiling" in Talker... then search xkcd if you don't get it)

Our particular instance is maintained here: <https://github.com/vance-group/vrbot> and is presently being hosted/run on Ryan's heroku account. So for now, ping Ryan to update if you make a change.
